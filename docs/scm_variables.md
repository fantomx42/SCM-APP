# SCM Variable Definitions

## Core Metrics

### Base Stability ($S_{base}$)

The inherent stability of a symbol before any external pressures are applied.

### Collapse Pressure ($P_{collapse}$)

The external force exerted on a symbol that tends to destabilize it.

### Modifier Block ($M$)

A set of modifiers that adjust the stability based on context.

### Damping Block ($D$)

A mechanism to prevent rapid fluctuations in stability.

### Fusion Coefficient ($F$)

Determines the likelihood of two symbols fusing into a new, more complex symbol.

### Confidence Metric ($C$)

The system's confidence in the calculated SCM value.
