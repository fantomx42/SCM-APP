# UX Researcher Role Definition

## Overview

The UX Researcher is responsible for shaping the user experience of the Symbolic Lab application, ensuring it feels like "ChatGPT but SCM-aware." This role bridges the gap between complex SCM dynamics and intuitive user interaction, focusing on conversational flow, cognitive load, and symbol clarity.

## Responsibilities

### Conversational Flow Design

- **"ChatGPT but SCM-aware"**: Design interactions that mimic the natural, fluid conversation of an LLM but with deep awareness of the underlying SCM state.
- **Contextual Awareness**: Ensure the system references past symbols, current stability, and potential collapse risks in a way that feels organic, not robotic.
- **Turn-taking**: Define how the system should handle turn-taking, especially when interrupting for critical SCM alerts (e.g., imminent collapse).

### Low-Cognitive-Load Interactions

- **Simplicity First**: Prioritize interfaces that require minimal mental effort to understand and navigate.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complex SCM data (like full modifier block details) only when requested or relevant, keeping the default view clean.
- **Visual Cues**: Use color, motion, and iconography to convey state changes (e.g., stability dropping) without overwhelming the user with text.

### Symbol Clarity Testing

- **Intuitiveness**: Test symbols and icons with users to ensure they intuitively represent their underlying SCM concepts (e.g., does a "cracked shield" clearly convey "low stability"?).
- **Consistency**: Ensure symbols are used consistently across the application to build a reliable mental model for the user.
- **Accessibility**: Verify that symbols are distinguishable by users with different visual abilities (e.g., color blindness).

### UI Telemetry Guidance

- **Engagement Metrics**: Define metrics to track how users interact with SCM features (e.g., frequency of expanding the "Modifier Block" view).
- **Error Rates**: Monitor confusion points where users frequently undo actions or seek help.
- **Flow Analysis**: Analyze user paths to identify friction points in the conversational flow or SCM visualization.
