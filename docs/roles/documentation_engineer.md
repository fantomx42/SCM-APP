# Documentation Engineer

## Role Overview

The Documentation Engineer is responsible for maintaining the technical accuracy, clarity, and completeness of all project documentation. This role bridges the gap between complex SCM (Symbolic Collapse Metric) mechanics and developer understanding.

- Ensure all endpoints are documented with request/response examples.
- Document error codes and edge cases.

### 2. SCM Variable Definitions

- Ensure definitions are mathematically precise and consistent with the codebase.

### 3. Full LaTeX Spec (v3.1)

- Maintain the authoritative LaTeX specification for SCM v3.1.
- Ensure the spec reflects the latest theoretical advancements and implementation details.

### 4. Architecture Specs

- Document high-level system architecture.
- Create and maintain diagrams for data flow, component interactions, and deployment topology.

### 5. Developer Guides

- Write "How-to" guides for common tasks (e.g., adding a new SCM modifier, debugging fusion).
- Maintain the "Getting Started" guide for new contributors.
