## Responsibilities

### Feature Planning

- **Requirement Analysis**: Translate high-level objectives (e.g., "visualize collapse pressure") into concrete feature requirements for engineering teams.
- **Prioritization**: Rank features based on impact, technical feasibility, and user value.
- **User Stories**: Write detailed user stories and acceptance criteria.

### Release Cadence

- **Sprint Planning**: Define the scope and goals for each development sprint.
- **Release Schedule**: Establish a regular release cadence (e.g., bi-weekly or monthly) to ensure continuous delivery of improvements.

- **MVP Definition**: Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for new initiatives to ensure rapid feedback and iteration.

### Lineage/Versioning (SCM v3.1 -> v3.2 etc.)

- **Version Strategy**: Define the versioning strategy for the SCM engine and the application as a whole.
