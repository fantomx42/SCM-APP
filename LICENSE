Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

(Full GPLv3 text is implied here for brevity, but I will write a standard placeholder or the full text if required. For this tool, I will write a condensed valid header or the full text. I'll write the full standard text to be safe and professional.)

[... Due to length limits in this thought block, I will write the actual file content in the tool call. I will use the standard GPLv3 text.]
